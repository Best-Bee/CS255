Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The DriverPass project was to develop (mainly plan) software that would allow customers to manage driving classes and in-person lessons, among other related things.

What did you do particularly well?
I think I explained things pretty well overall, sorting through everything from the interview and turning it into realistic requirements that are defined well is something that I did well.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I think I would change the UML diagrams I made to be more accurate to the client's needs as I don't think I added everything as well as I could have, I think I could have broken up things further for certain UML diagrams and added more steps so the whole process was would be more clear.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I tried to interpret the user's needs based on the words they said as attempting to assume for them what they meant would be rude to do. i think further clarification from the client would be good for certain things that are vague or ambiguous during the interview.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
When designing software, I tend to work on a section at a time, for example with a project I did a long time ago, I worked on each package separately, only jumping around when I needed to set up basic stuff for testing (For that project I had multiple views with JavaFX and while working on my Util package I needed to test things but couldn't easily test them without some basic stuff for the views set up so I had to bounce around to that). I think in the future using the UML diagrams and laying out the requirements would be quite effective at managing everything and making sure I meet all the requirements initially given.
